/* Tournament set state and the CSS score keybinds (design 6.1).
 *
 * Keybinds, active on the CSS only while a set is current (any port):
 *   Z + C-left        P1 wins a game (sends REPORT_SCORE)
 *   Z + C-right       P2 wins a game (sends REPORT_SCORE)
 *   Z + C-down        undo the last game (sends REPORT_SCORE)
 *   Z + C-up (1 s)    end the set (sends END_SET; needs a decided score)
 *   Z + X             flag/unflag the next game as a handwarmer (not scored;
 *                     clears itself after that game)
 *   D-pad up/down     rumble on/off for that port (venue mod, any time)
 *
 * The score is drawn along the bottom of the CSS as "MANGO P1  2 - 1  P3
 * ZAIN" (the port that picked each entrant's nametag), with a status line
 * above it: SENDING... / SCORE SENT / SEND FAILED, else the next game
 * (GAME n or HANDWARMER). Inputs are ignored while a request is in flight.
 * Games carry winners only (R13). */
