# The tournament module (`tournament.bin`)

Since 2026-09-24 the kiosk is not a rebuilt Melee: the venue Wiis (and Dolphin) run a **stock
Melee 1.02 ISO** and our code is a position-fixed blob that the loader copies into RAM at boot
and wires in with a short list of word patches. Design rationale and history:
`tournament-reporter/docs/design.md` sec 4.7 and R11/R12. The shifted-DOL line (v1-v39,
`SmashTournament-vN.iso`) is frozen at tag `shifted-dol-final` on branch `reporter`.

## What is in it

| TU | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/melee/mn/mntourney.c` | Tournament menu (set list, filter, confirm, error, loading), boot warm-up, `forceKioskDefaults` |
| `src/melee/lb/lbtourney.c` | set state, CSS binds, nametag seeding + who-is-who (tags or the L+R port claim), Z+X handwarmer, auto-score from `MatchEnd`, the score in the CSS banner, overlays |
| `src/melee/lb/lbrelayexi.c` | EXI driver for the relay device (channel 1 / device 0 / freq 4) |
| `src/melee/lb/lbbuttonglyph.c` | button icons: 4 I4 32x32 shapes in SIS font slot 4 (`lbbuttonglyph_shapes.inc` from `tools/gen_button_glyphs.py`) |
| `src/melee/lb/lbmodule_glue.c` | vanilla statics the kiosk reads (`mnCharSel_*`), `tm_bootOnLoad`, `tm_menuLightColor` |

Compiled with the DOL's MWCC flags plus `-sdata 0 -sdata2 0 -DTOURNAMENT_MODULE` (no
small-data sections: r2/r13-relative addressing cannot reach a blob at the top of MEM1). Every
vanilla function/variable the TUs use is resolved from `config/GALE01/symbols.txt` (which *is*
the 1.02 layout) into an absolute `sym = 0xADDR;` line of a generated LCF; an unresolved
external fails the build.

## Build

```
python tools/build_module.py        # -> build/GALE01/tournament.bin (~26 KB)
```

Prerequisite: a configured decomp tree (`python configure.py --non-matching` once, for the
compilers and the vanilla DOL in `orig/GALE01/sys/main.dol`). Objects go to `build/module/`;
delete them to force a clean rebuild. The output ends with the applied patch list, the guard
check and the file size.

## File format

```
"TMOD"  u32 version=1  u32 load_addr  u32 blob_len  u32 n_patches
u32 guard_addr (0x8016D800)  u32 guard_word (0x7C0802A6)
n_patches x { u32 addr, u32 value }
blob  (.text + .rodata + .data + .bss zero-filled), copied to load_addr
```

Load address `0x817E0000`: top of MEM1, below the FST (`0x817F8AC0`); ~100 KB of room. The
loader must (1) find `guard_word` at `guard_addr` - stock 1.02 in RAM, nothing else gets
patched; (2) require `*(0x80000034) >= load_addr + blob_len` (BootInfo arenaHi, which Melee's
`OSInit` adopts), (3) copy the blob, (4) write the patches, (5) write `load_addr` to
`0x80000034` so the arena stops below the module, (6) invalidate the icache over both ranges.
Two loaders exist and must stay equivalent: Nintendont `kernel/Patch.c LoadTournamentModule`
(reads `sd:/tournament.bin` in the full-DOL patch pass) and Ishiiruka
`Source/Core/Core/Boot/Boot_BS2Emu.cpp LoadTournamentModule` (path from `SlippiTournamentModule`
in `Dolphin.ini`, needs `HLE_BS2 = True`).

## Patches (`tools/module_hooks.txt`)

One line per patch: `ptr <addr> <symbol>` (write the module symbol's address), `branch <addr>
<symbol>` (write `b symbol` over a vanilla function's first instruction), `word <addr> <hex>`.
Today: scene-table rows (GS_MENU exit, GS_VS frame/exit, GS_CSS frame/exit), the main-menu
think, the hijacked Trophies row (kind 3: think, description indices, selection count,
anim/start_frame, panel-animation rows, light-colour jump-table entries), `bootOnLoad` and
`mn_8022C010` branches. The builder decodes every Nintendont codeset in `kernel/gecko/` and
refuses a patch or blob range that a gecko `04`/`C2` also touches - gecko codes are applied
after the module and would win silently.

## Rules

- No new files on the disc, ever. New assets go into the blob or are streamed from the SD card
  through the relay EXI device (both loaders' hosts already own that device).
- Vanilla addresses only, from `symbols.txt`; verify a hook is really reached (inlining! the
  light-colour function was inlined at both real call sites - 2026-09-24).
- Nothing the venue's codesets already do is re-implemented here: UCF, neutral spawns,
  striking, stealth tags, rumble toggle, music/mono are theirs.
- Per-build QA: `version-checklist.md`.
